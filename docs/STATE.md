# State

This file records modifications made to the project during agent-assisted work.

## Current State

- BattleNess is being restarted as a clean rebuild.
- No gameplay/application code has been implemented in this restart yet.
- Technical discussion is in progress before choosing the framework, architecture, data model, and tooling.

## Change Log

### 2026-06-25

- Added manual combat controls to `apps/prototype`, allowing the active player to select a target, use available rings, use ready monsters, end the turn, or concede while keeping scenario replay controls and the event log.
- Added localized UI labels for manual combat controls to the English and French locale files.

### 2026-06-24

- Connected `apps/prototype` to the combat engine so JSON scenarios can be selected, reset, stepped through, or executed fully from the browser UI, with player state, rings, monsters, remaining actions, errors, and event logs displayed through localized UI labels.
- Implemented the first executable combat-engine slice: fixture-to-`BattleSetup` building, battle state creation, `useRing`, `useMonster`, `endTurn`, `concede`, energy spending, cooldown updates, ring and gem damage, direct-damage spells, monster summons, Taunt targeting, first-turn hero damage protection, monster destruction, battle end checks, and JSON scenario execution tests.
- Added the initial TypeScript monorepo skeleton with pnpm workspaces, shared TypeScript config, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions CI, `packages/content`, `packages/engine`, and `apps/prototype`.
- Added initial content definitions, prototype fixtures, localization files, Zod schemas, engine contract types, basic setup validation, starter tests, and a Vite prototype preview.
- Added the initial implementation contract to `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/RESUME.md`, covering definition files, prototype fixtures, locale files, initial data shapes, `BattleSetup`, battle actions, event log types, and first scenario fixtures.
- Corrected the content and player-data model in `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/RESUME.md`, and `docs/AGENT.md`: BattleNess has no predefined hero classes, JSON files hold reusable content definitions, prototype fixtures simulate database-owned player and inventory data, item sockets/enchantments/levels/quality belong to player-owned instances, and the combat engine receives validated `BattleSetup` objects instead of reading JSON directly.
- Added remaining product and platform decisions to `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/RESUME.md`, and `docs/AGENT.md`: static prototype deployment, GitHub Actions CI, Node LTS with Corepack, initial workspace layout, WebSocket multiplayer, live PvP first, reconnectable matches, private match codes before matchmaking, OAuth-first authentication, localization from the beginning, organized asset pipeline, future audio, action-log match history, and JSON content as source of truth with optional database import.
- Added technical stack decisions to `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/RESUME.md`, and `docs/AGENT.md`: TypeScript monorepo, Vite DOM prototype app, pnpm, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier, no backend for the first prototype, Prisma for future persistence work, and Nuxt plus Phaser as a proposed long-term application shape.
- Added the visual color reference from the color code image to `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/RESUME.md`.
- Added engine and content format decisions to `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/RESUME.md`, and `docs/AGENT.md`: readable camelCase string IDs, typed action commands, detailed event logs, deterministic seeded randomness, single-action and multi-action scenario fixtures, and Zod-style JSON validation.
- Added combat and tooling decisions to `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/RESUME.md`, and `docs/AGENT.md`: three direct-damage test spells, Taunt applying to direct-damage spells, self-targeting ignoring enemy Taunt, immediate monster removal on death, rings starting ready, split JSON content files, and both unit and JSON scenario tests for the engine.
- Added spell and prototype-stat decisions to `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/RESUME.md`: no healing mechanics, a direct-damage test spell, broad spell targeting including self-damage, post-ring spell resolution, direct JSON combat values for the first prototype, a future stat-formula boundary, and immediate battle end after complete action resolution.
- Added additional combat rule decisions to `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/RESUME.md`, including repeated element duels on ties, floor rounding for elemental advantage, summon failure on full boards, multiple-Taunt targeting, enchantment behavior after target death, draw results, minimum ring cost, and the initial spell-effect scope.
- Added elemental design direction from the elemental features reference image to `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/RESUME.md`.
- Updated combat rule decisions in `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/RESUME.md`, including speed tie-breakers, per-player energy progression, cooldown timing, action count, targeting, Taunt, monster board size, duplicate summons, first-turn protection, ring resolution order, and elemental advantage.
- Updated `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/RESUME.md`, and `docs/AGENT.md` with newly confirmed technical direction: TypeScript across the stack, a pure deterministic combat engine, JSON prototype content, and a local combat prototype as the first milestone.
- Added a documentation language rule to `docs/AGENT.md`: all new information added to files in `docs/` should be written in English.
- Added `docs/RESUME.md` as a handoff document for continuing BattleNess planning and development on another computer or with another agent.
- Rewrote `docs/RESUME.md` after the file was moved into the documentation directory.

### 2026-06-05

- Added a proposed game rules specification to `docs/PROJECT.md`, separating executable combat rules and unresolved rule questions from implementation decisions.
- Added a proposed BattleNess glossary to `docs/PROJECT.md` covering combat, actors, items, stats, elements, progression, and economy.
- Added explicit technical decision tracking to `docs/PROJECT.md`, separating decided, proposed, and undecided topics.
- Replaced the previous unrelated state history with a clean BattleNess baseline.
- Added persistent agent instructions in `docs/AGENT.md`.
- Added the initial project summary, rules summary, and technical baseline in `docs/PROJECT.md`.
